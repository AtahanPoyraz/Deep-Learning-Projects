# Deep Learning Project
This project aims to develop artificial intelligence applications using deep learning methods. It includes model training, optimization, and solution generation processes for different datasets and problems.

---
## Project Structure
Each project follows this general structure:

* `applications/`: Contains the application files for the project. These files handle tasks such as running the model, processing data, and generating results. You don't need to train the model to run the applications; you can directly use the pre-trained model stored in the `artifacts/` folder.

* `artifacts/`: Contains files generated during model training, such as model files, training history graphs, and other visual outputs. If you'd like to see the training process, you can run the model training script from `model.py`.

* `model.py`: The Python file where the model is defined and trained. Running this file will initiate the training process and generate the trained model and outputs in the `artifacts/` folder.

* `requirements.txt`: Specifies the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

* **Install Dependencies**: This will install all the necessary Python libraries and packages needed for the project to run correctly. Make sure you have a virtual environment set up before running this command to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

* **Run the Application**: You can run the application script to see how the model performs. For example:
    ```
    python applications/example.py
    ```

    __Note__: Running the application does not require training the model. The application will use the pre-trained model stored in the `artifacts/` folder.

* **Train the Model** (Optional): If you'd like to train the model and see the training results, you can run the `model.py` file:
    ```
    python model.py
    ```

* **View Training Results**: After training, the generated models and visual outputs can be found in the `artifacts/` folder.
